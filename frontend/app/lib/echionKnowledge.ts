    response: `EchoRoom is a collaborative learning platform.

Communities:
• Share ideas
• Test them through experiments
• Record real outcomes
• Reflect on what they learned

It focuses on learning loops — not just discussion or voting.

The goal is not to win ideas.
The goal is to learn from trying them.`

    response: `Unlike traditional idea platforms, EchoRoom does not stop at discussion.

It encourages:
Idea → Experiment → Outcome → Reflection → Shared Learning

The emphasis is on action and documented learning, not popularity.`

• "Start Exploring" takes you to the Ideas page.
• "Learn More" explains the EchoRoom project in detail.

Most users begin by exploring Ideas.`

1. Browse Ideas
2. Create your own Idea
3. Turn it into an Experiment
4. Record the Outcome
5. Write a Reflection

That’s the EchoRoom learning loop.`

1. Go to the Ideas page
2. Click "Create Idea"
3. Add title and description

To create:
1. Go to Experiments page
2. Click "New Experiment"
3. Add hypothesis and duration
4. Optionally link it to an Idea

Experiments move thinking into action.`

They classify:
• Success
• Failure
• Mixed result

Outcomes lead into Reflections.`

To create:
1. Go to Reflections page
2. Link to an Outcome
3. Write insights and improvements

Reflections turn experience into shared knowledge.`

Draft Ideas remain private.

Experiments and Reflections are connected to Ideas and Outcomes within the learning structure.`
